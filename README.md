# File Player Plugin

The purpose of this plugin is to experiment with a CLAP-first
plugin development workflow. The current workflow is as follows:
- A CLAP plugin base (using clap-helpers)
- A JUCE plugin GUI (may change in the future)
- CLAP wrappers for VST3, AU, and Standalone

TODOs:
- What about AUv3/iOS?
- Actually implement the engine and UI

More to come!
